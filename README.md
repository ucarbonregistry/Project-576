______________
The proposed project titled under UCR is “3.8 MW Solar Power Project by M/s Savitri Alloys”, which
is a grid connected solar power project located in the district Aravalli, in the state of Gujarat, in India.
The purpose of this power is for captive consumption. The promoter of the project activity is ‘M/s
Savitri Alloys’ (herein after called as Project Proponent or PP). PP has the full ownership of the project
activity. This project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being
applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source
of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of 3.8 MW (i.e., 3835 kWp) is installation
and operation of solar power plant at Village – Indran, Taluka – Bayad, in Aravalli district in the state
of Gujarat are per details listed below:
